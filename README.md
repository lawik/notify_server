To get it working you need node.js. The rest of the installed stuff is evilly and nastily included in the repository. Proof of concept code as it is.

Run:

    node app.js

And:

    node static.js

The first is the socket.io server, the other one serves the notifications lib. Visit http://localhost:4433/index.html and enjoy ;)
